      "description": "The F30 wheel loader is perfect as a powerful and compact machine for construction and agricultural use. The entire machine is well thought out and developed to the highest quality standards, capable of withstanding heavy workloads. The powerful 4-cylinder diesel engine gives this compact loader enough power to excel even in professional applications. With the control valve, which also allows for a locked third control circuit and a floating position, the machine is also perfect for applications in garden and landscape construction.",
